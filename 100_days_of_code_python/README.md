## 100 Days of Python Journey ðŸš€ 
Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** journey! This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and code challenges I've completed while mastering Python. The goal of this journey was to learn Python by building real-world projects, covering topics from basic syntax to advanced data science libraries and machine learning algorithms.

### Project Highlights:
- **Day 1-10**: Python Fundamentals (Loops, Functions, Conditionals)  
- **Day 11-20**: Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples)  
- **Day 21-30**: Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance)  
- **Day 31-40**: File Handling, JSON, and Web Scraping  
- **Day 41-50**: APIs and Automation  
- **Day 51-60**: Data Analysis with Pandas & NumPy  
- **Day 61-70**: Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- **Day 71-80**: Databases and SQL Integration  
- **Day 81-90**: Machine Learning Basics (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)  
- **Day 91-100**: Advanced Machine Learning and Final Projects

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Navigate to a specific project folder.
3. Run the Python script: `python script_name.py`

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue refining my skills and adding new projects!
