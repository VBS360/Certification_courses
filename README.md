**100 Days of Python Journey 🚀**
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python journey! This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and code challenges I've completed while mastering Python. The goal of this journey was to learn Python by building real-world projects, covering topics from basic syntax to advanced data science libraries and machine learning algorithms.

**Project Highlights:**
Day 1-10: Python Fundamentals (Loops, Functions, Conditionals)
Day 11-20: Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples)
Day 21-30: Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance)
Day 31-40: File Handling, JSON, and Web Scraping
Day 41-50: APIs and Automation
Day 51-60: Data Analysis with Pandas & NumPy
Day 61-70: Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
Day 71-80: Databases and SQL Integration
Day 81-90: Machine Learning Basics (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
Day 91-100: Advanced Machine Learning and Final Projects

**How to Use:**
- Clone the repository: git clone <repo_url>
- Navigate to a specific project folder.
- Run the Python script: python script_name.py

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue refining my skills and adding new projects!
